At the Data Science Collaborative (DS Collab for short), our goal is to make data science accessible for everyone. We are dedicated to providing accessible resources and services through one-on-one mentorships, career check-ins, study halls, foundational project workshops, and most importantly, a community full of like-minded people. We promise a deliverable that will be presented at our year-end showcase featuring guest lecturers and industry employers. Join us today to develop your passion in the world of statistics!
