Founded in 2023 by Kris Hao and Anya Macomber, the workshop series aims to provide an inclusive and collegial atmosphere where motivated students can engage more fully with real-world datasets and projects. Our goals as an organization are:

-   To make statistics **accessible** to all skill levels

-   To build a **community** around data science at UCSB

-   Ensure the success of our members by **guiding** them through their own **resume-building data science projects**
