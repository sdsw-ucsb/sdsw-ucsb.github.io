Founded in 2023 by Kris Hao and Anya Macomber, the workshop series aims to provide an inclusive and collegial atmosphere where motivated students can engage more fully with real-world datasets and projects. Our goals as an organization are:

-   To make statistics <b>accessible</b> to all skill levels

-   To build a <b>community</b> around data science at UCSB

-   Ensure te success of our members by <b>guiding</b> them through their own <b>resume-building data science projects</b>
